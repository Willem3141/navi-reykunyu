/**
 * Handling of strings with word links in them.
 * 
 * In Reykunyu's data, fields (such as etymology and meaning_note) may contain
 * references to other words in the form of word links such as "[kaltxì:intj]".
 * The format is an open bracket, the word, a colon, the word type, and a close
 * bracket.
 * 
 * When displaying these fields it is useful to include the meaning, so that a
 * meaning_note like "See also [kaltxì:intj]." gets displayed as something like
 * "See also → kaltxì (hello)." including a link to the word kaltxì so that
 * can find more information if necessary.
 * 
 * This file provides a function that finds word links in a string and enriches
 * them with (an abridged version) of the data for the corresponding word. The
 * output is an array that contains strings (for textual parts of the original
 * string, which are not word links) and objects (the data corresponding to a
 * word link). For example:
 * 
 * ```
 * [
 *     "See also ",
 *     {
 *         "na'vi": "kaltxì",
 *         "type": "intj",
 *         "translations": [...],
 *     }
 *     ".",
 * ]
 * ```
